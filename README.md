- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Requirements

- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Unless specified, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, ... is forbidden
- Do not include any `main` functions in your files
- All functions should have a prototype included in a header file called `sort.h`
- Don't forget to push your header file
- Your header file must be include guarded
- A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2
